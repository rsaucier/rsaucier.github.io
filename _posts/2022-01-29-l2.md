title: Calculating the Location of Lagrangian Point L2
---

With the launching of the James Webb Space Telescope, and positioning it at the Lagrangian point L2,
you may be wondering how to calculate the location of this equilibrium point.
This was one of the problems in a standard physics textbook[^1]

We adapt the problem from the 1965 edition of the book by Marion, as the newer editions leave out this problem.
Refer to Fig. 10-11.

We have two large masses, $$M_1$$ and $$M_2$$, located at $$A$$ and $$B$$, respectively, and a much smaller mass $$m$$ located at point $$P$$.
We will be taking $$M_1$$ as the Sun, $$M_2$$ as the Earth, and $$m$$ as the JWST.
Since there is no known closed-form solution to the three-body problem, we will be finding approximate solutions, using the fact that $$m \ll M_2 \ll M_1$$.

The masses $$M_1$$ and $$M_2$$ are assumed to be moving in circular orbits about the center of mass, which is at the origin $$O$$ in Fig. 10-11.

By the definition of the center of mass,

$$
M_1 p s = M_2 ( 1 - p ) s .
$$

Solving this for $$p$$ gives

$$
p = \frac{M_2}{M} ,
$$

where $$M \equiv M_1 + M_2$$. Thus, $$M_1 = ( 1 - p ) M$$ and $M_2 = p M$$.
Let $$\omega$$ represent the angular velocity of the motion.
Then if $$m$$ is to be in a position of equilibrium, it must also be revolving about $$O$$ with a constant angular velocity $$\omega$$.
The masses $$M_1$$ and $$M_2$$ provide the centripetal force, so we have

$$
\boldsymbol{F}_1 + \boldsymbol{F}_2 + m r \omega^2 \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_r = 0 ,
$$

where the magnitudes of the forces are

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= G \frac{m M_1}{r_1^2} = G \frac{m M ( 1 - p )}{r_1^2} \\
F_2 &= G \frac{m M_2}{r_2^2} = G \frac{m M p}{r_2^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

In order for $$m$$ to be in equilibrium, the components of $$\boldsymbol{F}_1$$ and $$\boldsymbol{F}_2$$ perpendicular to $$\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_r$$ must be equal,
and the sum of the components along $$\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_r$$ must be equal to $$m r \omega^2$$.
The first of these requires

$$
F_1 \sin \psi_1 = F_2 \sin \psi_2 \tag{2} .
$$

Applying the law of sines to the triangle $$OAP$$, we have

$$
\frac{\sin \psi_1}{ps} = \frac{\sin \phi_1}{r} .
$$

But we also have

$$
\sin \phi_1 = \frac{y}{r_1} .
$$

Combining the two gives

$$
\sin \psi_1 = \frac{p s y}{r r_1} \tag{3} .
$$

Similarly, for triangle $$BOP$$,

$$
\frac{\sin \psi_2}{(1-p)s} = \frac{\sin \phi_2}{r}
$$

and

$$
\sin \phi_2 = \frac{y}{r_2} ,
$$

so that

$$
\sin \psi_2 = \frac{(1-p)s y}{r r_2} \tag{4} .
$$

Therefore, from eqs. (3) and (4), we have

$$
\frac{\sin \psi_1}{\sin \psi_2} = \frac{psy}{r r_1} \frac{r r_2}{(1-p) s y} = \frac{p y r_2}{(1-p) y r_1} ,
$$

and from eqs. (1) and (2), we have

$$
\frac{\sin \psi_1}{\sin \psi_2} = \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{G m M p}{r_2^2} \frac{r_1^2}{G m M (1-p)} = \frac{p r_1^2}{(1-p) r_2^2} .
$$

Equating these two then gives

$$
\frac{y}{r_1^3} = \frac{y}{r_2^3} .
$$

We therefore have two possible solutions: (1) $$r_1 = r_2$$, and (2) $$y = 0$$.
For the first case the three mases form an equilateral triangle, which would correspond to $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ in Fig. 10-12,
and for the second case the three masses are co-linear, corresponding to $$U_1$$, $$U_2$$, and $$U_3$$ in Fig. 10-12.
Here we are interested in the second solution, $$y = 0$$.

![Fig. 10-12]({% link /assets/images/fig10-12.png %})

Next we need to calculate the value of $$\omega^2$$.
We can do this by equating the gravitational and centrifugal forces on, say $$M_1$$ (refer to Fig. 10-11):

$$
G \frac{M_1 M_2}{s^2} = M_1 ps \omega^2 ,
$$

which gives

$$
\omega^2 = \frac{G M_2}{ps^3} = \frac{GM}{s^3} . \tag{5}
$$

Now, we want to show that if the mass $$M_2$$ is much smaller than $$M_1$$ (which implies $$p \ll 1$$),
then the equilibrium points $$U_2$$ and $$U_3$$ are approximately symmetrical about $$M_2$$ and lie at distances from $$M_2$$ approximately equal to $$s \sqrt[3]{p/3}$$.

The gravitational forces provide the centripetal force, so we have from eqs. (1) and (5),

$$
\frac{G m M ( 1 - p )}{r_1^2} \pm \frac{G m M p}{r_2^2} = m \omega^2 r = m \frac{G M}{s^3} [ ( 1-p) s \pm \Delta ] ,
$$

where the positive sign corresponds to the position $$U_3$$, and the negative sign to position $$U_2$$, in Fig. 10-12,
and $$\Delta$$ is the positive distance of $$m$$ from $$M_24$.
This simplifies to

$$
\frac{1-p}{r_1^2} \pm \frac{p}{r_2^2} = \frac{(1-p) s \pm d}{s^3} .
$$

Now, $$r_1 = s \pm \Delta$$ and $$r_2 = \Delta$$, so this becomes

$$
\frac{1-p}{(s \pm \Delta)^2} \pm \frac{p}{\Delta^2} = \frac{(1-p) s \pm \Delta}{s^3} \quad \implies \quad \frac{1-p}{s^2 ( 1 \pm \Delta / s )^2} \pm \frac{1}{s^2} \frac{p}{(\Delta/s)^2} = \frac{1-p \pm \Delta/s}{s^2}
$$

or

$$
(1-p)(1 \pm \Delta/s)^{-2} \pm \frac{p}{(\Delta/s)^2} = 1 - p \pm \Delta/s .
$$

Since $$\Delta / s \ll 1$$, we can use the binomial expansion,

$$
( 1 \pm \Delta / s )^{-2} = 1 \mp (2) (\Delta / s) \pm \frac{1}{2!} ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( \Delta/s)^2 \mp \frac{1}{3!} (2) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) (\Delta/s)^3 \pm \cdots
$$

to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pm \frac{p}{(\Delta/s)^2} &= 1 - p \pm \Delta/s - (1-p)(1 \pm \Delta/s)^{-2} \\
&= 1 - p \pm \Delta/s - (1-p) ( 1 \mp 2 \Delta/s \pm \cdots ) \\
&= 1 - p \pm \Delta/s - 1 \pm 2 \Delta /s + p \mp 2 p \Delta / s \pm \cdots \\
&= (\pm 3 \mp 2 p ) \Delta/s \pm \cdots
\end{aligned}
$$

so, the approximate solutions are

$$
( \Delta / s ) ^3 = \frac{ \pm p}{\pm 3 \mp 2 p} = \frac{p}{3 - 2p } \quad \text{and} \quad ( \Delta / s )^3 = \frac{-p}{-3 + 2 p} = \frac{p}{3 - 2p } 
$$

Thus we have the same solution in both cases.
And since $$p \ll 1$$, we have

$$
( \Delta / s ) ^3  \approx \frac{p}{3} \left ( 1 + \frac{2}{3} p \right ) \approx \frac{p}{3}  = \frac{M_2}{3 M}
$$

so that

$$
\boxed{\Delta \approx s \sqrt[3]{\frac{M_2}{3M}}}
$$

Thus, the Lagrangian points $$L_1$$ and $$L_2$$ are approximately equidistant from the earth.
Now we put in some numbers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
M_1 \equiv M_{\text{sun}} &\approx 2 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} \\
M_2 \equiv M_{\text{earth}} &\approx 6 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg} \\
s &\approx 150 \times 10^6 \text{ km}
\end{aligned}
$$

and find that the distance from the earth is

$$
\Delta \approx 150 \times 10^6 \text{ kg} \left ( \frac{6 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}}{3 ( 2 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} ) } \right )^{1/3} = 150 \times 10^4 \text{ km} = 1.5 \text{ million km} = 931,677 \text{ miles} ,
$$

where $$L_1$$ is in Region 1 and $$L_2$$ is in region 2.
Travel time for a signal between the  Earth and the JWST, located at $$L_2$$, is 5 seconds.
