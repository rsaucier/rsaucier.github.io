This document describes two C++ classes for performing vector algebra and vector rotations in 3D.
Each class is self-contained in a single header file (Vector.h and Rotation.h) so that a C++ programmer
only has to include the header file to make use of the code. Examples and reference sheets are provided to serve
as guidance in using the classes.
